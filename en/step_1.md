On the left-hand side of the editor, there is a **simulator**. The simulator is a virtual micro:bit that you can use to test your code. 

The simulator has all the features and buttons found on a micro:bit V2, including:
+ LED display
+ Speaker
+ Microphone
+ Input buttons:
    + A
    + B
    + Logo

In the centre of the editor, there is the **blocks panel**. The blocks panel is colour-coded and allows you to access various code blocks.

On the right-hand side of the editor, there is the **code editor panel**. The code editor panel is where you will drag and drop blocks when you are creating your program.

The code editor panel already contains two blocks: `on start` and `forever`.
